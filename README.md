# Karlincam Projects

## What is [Karlincam](https://www.karlincam.cz)?

A website with different nature related topics. Some articles also translated into Chech. The factual content is related to Central Europe, especially the Czech Republic and the German-speaking regions. Visit me and my best wife of all at [https://www.karlincam.cz](https://www.karlincam.cz).

However, some features are based on specially configured applications and developments of versatile software solutions. Partly with dedicated hardware, like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) or the [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth).

## This Repository

This repository combines the individual different projects and configurations that are managed thematically as individual repositories. I give a brief overview of each here. Some projects are not yet fully implemented. In this case, the associated repository is not yet public.
