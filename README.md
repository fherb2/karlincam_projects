# Karlincam Projects

## What is [Karlincam](https://www.karlincam.cz)?

A website with different nature related topics. Some articles also translated into Chech. The factual content is related to Central Europe, especially the Czech Republic and the German-speaking regions. Visit me and my best wife of all at [https://www.karlincam.cz](https://www.karlincam.cz).

However, some features are based on specially configured applications and developments of versatile software solutions. Partly with dedicated hardware, like the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) or the [AudioMoth](https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth).

## This Repository

This repository combines the individual different projects and configurations that are managed thematically as individual repositories. I give a brief overview of each here. Some projects are not yet fully implemented. In this case, the associated repository is not yet public.

## [search.karlincam.cz](https://search.karlincam.cz)

Not just another search engine. It specializes in hand-selected websites on various topics related to nature in the Central European region. Especially of the German and Czech language area.

This special search engine is based on the [YaCy project](https://yacy.net/) but is not coupled to the YaCy freeworld network. This search and indexing system is rich-full with configurations to crawl only relevant content. Despite we need some more tricks to collect the right web pages and contents. So I added [Privoxy](https://www.privoxy.org/) as "man in the middle" in order to filter out some non relevant content, like incorrectly configured robots.txt files. Additional I use Privoxy to manipulate web page content in order to filter out some non relevant content or links on this pages which makes crawling inefficient.

The project is not yet pushed to Github. But, comes in the next time.
